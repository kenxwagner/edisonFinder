        <h2>The goal</h2>
        <p>
            How many businesses want access to good ideas and inventions? How many inventors want to solve small business needs?
        </p>
        <p>How many more ideas and inventions will show up if small businesses and innovators have a chance to meet to discus?</p>
        <p>Inventors, join an post your ideas (even if they have already been invented) in a concept and businesses join to see if an inventor has ideas you like and is in your area and meet them.  </p>
        <p>Practice due dillegence and make sure your ideas can be protected.</p>

        <h2>Inventor</h2>
        <p>Simply put: You have more than just one idea, so post the simple concept (such as "coffee maker" or a "training robot") or your ideas so that members can see them.</p>
        <p>The reality is this:  Being super secret and paranoid is a waste of time. Your idea will not get stolen because you said you have an idea for the best fitness bracelet or an electric car. If you publish information, make prototypes and put them on Youtube, etc without patent protection, then you risk it all.</p>
